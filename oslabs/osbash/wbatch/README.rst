Files in this directory are Windows batch files generated by osbash to
configure host-only networks, produce a base disk, and build OpenStack
training-labs VMs as configured when osbash created them.

When copying these files to a Windows host, make sure to preserve the
Windows-style CR/LF newlines, or the batch scripts may fail (e.g. not
find jump labels).
